# VaultGuardian
VaultGuardian is a secure Flask-based password manager that encrypts credentials, supports multi-factor authentication (TOTP &amp; email OTP), and provides a clean dashboard for adding, editing, and managing sensitive data. Built with Flask, WTForms, and Bootstrap for a modern, user-friendly experience.

# Testing

Run the VaultGuardian test suite locally with a virtual environment. These tests use a temporary JSON file as the datastore and stub email sending, so they wonâ€™t touch real data or SMTP.
